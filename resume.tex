	At Intrepid I lead the development of the web app component of the
	\href{http://intrepidlearning.com/what-we-do/learning-technology/intrepid-agile/}{Intrepid Agile}
	product. I built a PHP MVC framework that would allow interaction with the
	REST-based API of the back end CMS, which is implemented in Java, using
	MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

	I have also done significant work implementing functionality using modern
	modern javascript techniques with Backbone and RequireJS. Additionally, I
	manage releases for our currenty deployed projects and maintain Ant build
	scripts which allow rapid building \& deploying of the codebase using Jenkins.

		As one of a handful of employees in this startup, I was responsible for
